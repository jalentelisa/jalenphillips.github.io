          <h4>01. Overview</h4>
           <p>Koinonia Christian Center is a thriving religious institution with a rapidly growing congregation. Recognizing the increasing importance of digital engagement, they have already embraced online giving through platforms like CashApp and PayPal. Additionally, they have integrated digital media to extend their reach across various social platforms. However, with their rising popularity nationwide and a limited team to manage the influx of online interactions, they see the need for a dedicated app. This app would streamline
             giving, enhance communication, and offer a more personalized experience for their expanding community.
           </p>
           <br>
           <h4>02. Problem</h4>
           <p>Third-party processors such as CashApp and PayPal, while convenient, can sometimes be unreliable due to transaction delays, system outages, or varying fee structures. The use of multiple giving platforms also makes it challenging for the administrative board to maintain accurate and up-to-date financial records. With donations coming from several sources, tracking funds, reconciling accounts, and ensuring transparency becomes increasingly difficult. As the congregation continues to grow, there are additional concerns about how these varied giving methods might affect the church's tax liabilities, 
              especially when managing donations across multiple platforms that may not provide uniform reporting.</p>
              <br>
           
            <h4>03. Design Process</h4>
            <p>To address Koinonia Christian Center's donation and financial tracking challenges, the design process would begin with research into user needs and the limitations of current platforms.
                 A centralized app will be developed to streamline giving, automate financial tracking, and simplify tax reporting.<br>
                <strong>Research:</strong> I interviewed the churchâ€™s administrative board, staff, and congregants to identify key pain points with current donation methods and financial tracking.
                A survey was distributed to gather insights on user preferences for digital giving and app features. Next, I analyzied how other religious organizations use custom apps for donations and financial management.
                From this research, we identified goals and potential pain points regarding the app:
