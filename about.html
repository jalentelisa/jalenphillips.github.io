                <h4>Former Banking Professional Pivoting into the Design World</h4>
                <p>As a child, I always had dreams of becoming an artist. As time has passed, 
                    I now understand how to make my dream a reality. I am currently enrolled at the 
                    University of Memphis in persuit of my BFA. I am recently married, to my spouse who 
                    has the same name, Ja'Lon Phillips. We share a 6 year old son by the name of Jayce, 
                    who keeps us busy with his concerts and game challenges. My "Me Time" is defined by heavy leg days at the gym. I also enjoy watching intense cooking shows on Netflix. Embracing a new chapter is challenging, however, my background in finance has equipped me with a strong foundation in attention to detail, which I now apply to design challenges. It has also prepared me for creative problem-solving strategies, analytical approaches to timeline contraints, and priortizing teamwork. 
                    <br><br> 
                    Balancing family, fitness, and a new career keeps me grounded and motivated every day.
                    My design approach is more concept-driven. I enjoy brain storming sessions 
                    where we define the foundational idea or concept of a design. 
                    This approach allows me the opportunity to create meaningful and impactful projects, that often tell a story that the client or company is proud of. As I continue my journey in design, I look forward to exploring new ideas and collaborating on exciting projects!
