                     <br>
                        <p>As a child, I always had dreams of becoming an artist. As time has passed, I now understand how to make my dream a reality. I am currently enrolled at the University of Memphis in persuit of my BFA. I am recently married, to my spouse who has the same name, <em>Ja'Lon Phillips</em>.
                     We share a 6 year old son by the name of <em>Jayce</em>, who keeps us busy with his concerts and game challenges. My "Me Time" is defined by heavy leg days at the gym. I also enjoy watching intense cooking shows on Netflix.
                     Embracing a new chapter is challenging, however, my background in finance has equipped me with a strong foundation in attention to detail, which I now apply to design challenges. 
                        It has also prepared me for creative problem-solving strategies, analytical approaches to timeline contraints, and priortizing teamwork. Balancing family, fitness, and a new career keeps me grounded and motivated every day.
                        <br><br>
                        My <strong>design approach</strong> is more concept-driven. I enjoy brain storming sessions where we define the foundational idea or concept of a design. This approach allows me the opportunity to create meaningful and impactful projects, that often tell a story
                        that the client or company is proud of. As I continue my journey in design, I look forward to exploring new ideas and collaborating on exciting projects!
