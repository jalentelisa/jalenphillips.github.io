            <h4>01. Overview</h4>
            <p>Grace Talks: Diary of a Believer is a podcast that explores the joys and challenges of everyday life from a faith-based perspective. Blending elements of Bible study with personal reflections, it offers listeners intimate insights drawn from the host's own experiences. The creator envisions the podcast evolving into a vibrant community 
                where individuals can connect, engage, and share their journeys.

                <h4>02. Concept for Design</h4>
                <p>The concept for the cover was to resemble a diary or journal entry, featuring script-style handwriting to evoke a sense of intimacy, as if she had written it herself. The design also called for a fun, nostalgic collage to appeal to younger audiences, with pink as a key color. Using these guidelines, I created a simple sketch 
                    of the potential cover, and once the host approved it, I moved on to developing wireframes.

                <br>
                <h4>03. Design Process</h4>
              <p>The design process began with the idea of capturing the essence of a personal diary through handwritten script and collage elements. I incorporated paper pages, using newspaper clippings and a piece of paper to highlight the collage concept while ensuring the script remained clear. The bold title anchored the design, with "Grace" collaged using the newspaper clippings, and "Talk" in bold pink letters to meet the color requirements and balance the collage effect. To add a nostalgic, playful vibe for younger audiences, I incorporated picture frames of the host, tying her personal memories to the show's themes. Final touches like doodles and cut-out 
                flowers were added to mimic a genuine diary entry, enhancing both the intimacy and visual appeal.
